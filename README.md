Here is a project of my that trying create a chat bot for EDA.

I am imagning a chat that you can ask questions about your data and it will answer you.
You can ask for it create a plot for you and it will in the chat, you can split the chat into new chats, create new tables and download them, upload new data, and more.

I am not sure how it will move forward, but I am sure that it will be fun.

might chnage the license to later on, but for now it is Apache 2.0
